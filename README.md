# Scenery models for Flight Simulator 2020.

No experience with 3D, but will finalise a couple of buildings and stadia over the next few weeks in spare time. 

First project: Cardington hangers near Bedford.  As requested at https://www.reddit.com/r/FS2020Creation/comments/igy1av/cardington_sheds_modelling_request/

Seemed like a simple first choice,  the hangers are indeed sorely absent from the current release, so hopefully this contribution makes it better for those wanting what remain some of the largest structures in Europe.
