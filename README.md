# Scenery models for Flight Simulator 2020.

Follow me on twitter @timhuckle for updates and new packs.

1. Cardington hangers near Bedford.  As requested at https://www.reddit.com/r/FS2020Creation/comments/igy1av/cardington_sheds_modelling_request/

2. Old Trafford, Manchester.  Work in progress, need to add floodlights and tidy up the surrounding areas.  I intend to re-do the cricket ground and the AJ Bell stadium in Manchester.  Will then focus on other premiership grounds.  Likely to avoid Google map data where possible.

3. The Lovell Telescope at the Jodrell Bank Observatory (Unesco World Heritage Site) http://www.jodrellbank.net/visit/whats-here/lovell-telescope/ ,  53°14′11″N 2°18′30″W﻿
