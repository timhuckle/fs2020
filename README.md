# Scenery models for Flight Simulator 2020.

Follow me on twitter @timhuckle for updates and new packs.

First project: Cardington hangers near Bedford.  As requested at https://www.reddit.com/r/FS2020Creation/comments/igy1av/cardington_sheds_modelling_request/

Seemed like a simple first choice,  the hangers are indeed sorely absent from the current release, so hopefully this contribution makes it better for those wanting what remain some of the largest structures in Europe.

Second project:  Old Trafford, Manchester.  Work in progress, need to add floodlights and tidy up the surrounding areas.  I intend to re-do the cricket ground and the AJ Bell stadium in Manchester.  Will then focus on other premiership grounds.  Likely to avoid Google map data where possible.
